# Devops Katas

A kata is an exercise that a student repeats over and over to learn a skill.
This concept started in martial arts, but has jumped over to development. There
are hundreds of katas for dozens of languages.

But, there haven't been any katas for devops. Until now.

## Devops as a development practice

From all the definitions of devops, I like the following the best:

> Devops is the development practice of writing applications whose business domain is operations.

These katas are a way of teaching devops engineers how to use the amazing tools
that are out there while instilling the mindset of treating infrastructure as
code.

# The Katas

Some of the katas have been designed with a specific order in mind and build
upon each other. Where they do so, they will reference the appropriate katas. In
all cases, you are welcome to start anywhere.

The ones without a link are planned. If you don't see one you'd like to have,
please open an issue.

## How to use the Katas

Each of the katas has a very extensive README explaining:

* What you need to install.
* The steps you will take to see the problem(s) to solve.
* What you should expect to come away with.

Each kata also has a test suite already written and instructions on how to run
it. The primary goal of the kata is to make the test suite pass.

## Comments in all files

Every file provided in the kata has extensive comments explaining every concept
and, in most cases, each of the lines. The explanations include links to more
documentation.
