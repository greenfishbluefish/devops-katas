# Devops Katas

A kata is an exercise that a student repeats over and over to learn a skill.
This concept started in martial arts, but has jumped over to development. There
are hundreds of katas for dozens of languages.

But, there haven't been any katas for devops. Until now.

## Devops as a development practice

From all the definitions of devops, I like the following the best:

> Devops is the development practice of writing applications whose business domain is operations.

These katas are a way of teaching devops engineers how to use the amazing tools
that are out there while instilling the mindset of treating infrastructure as
code.

# The katas

The katas have been designed with a specific order in mind and build upon each
other. But, you are welcome to start anywhere.
